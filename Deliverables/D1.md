# 1. Introduction
Our project is a budgeting app that will provide easy to read reports for the
user to keep track of their budgeting needs. This app will give
monthly, weekly and even daily reports on a persons expenses as well as income.
Specifically this app is targeted towards college students or in general, young
newly financially responsible people that are struggling to handle the day to
day of managing their expenses. The problem that we are trying to solve with this
app is to remove the intimidating and confusing elements of budgeting that younger
people tend to avoid so that they can use this as a segway into potentially more
advanced concepts in the future when they have more finances to deal with.

# 2. Initial value proposition and consumer segments
BetrBudget will simplify what budgeting is. By removing advanced features,
it allows people to dip their toes in world of finances without jumping in
head first. Our consumer segments will be mainly younger people. Most likely
it will be people ages 18-25, but there may also be room for those that are
older or even younger high schoolers.

# 3. Interviews Summary
We interviewed 9 people on campus, our sample was of college students at NAU
ages 18-22. We interviewed these people on February 5th, 2022 from 12-2pm.
The biggest thing we pulled from these interviews was that college students
who show interest in having a platform for budgeting actually prefer simplicity
over anything else. The reason being that these people don't deal with a whole lot
of expense quite yet so there is not an absolute need to manage their finances, but
a strong desire to keep track of them in order to handle money saving. One
interviewee even stated that they tried to use other budgeting apps but were turned off
to them because the features provided were too confusing and advanced for them. These
features included things such as stock tracking and mortgage plans. After conducting
the interviews, the app we provide to college students would be nice to have more than
anything, but some students that handle more expenses than normal (particularly students
of less financially supportive backgrounds) find a huge use in budgeting apps and would
lean more towards the must have.

# 4. Final vlaue proposition and consumer segments.
Our product is a budgeting app that targets younger audiences that deal with day to day
finances. Using the app, they can effectively manage their finances. Our products 
unique point is its focus on simplicity and clean UI that other budgeting apps
do not provide because they assume an older target audience.

## MVP
Developing BetrBudgets minimum viable product (MVP) our strategy is to first develop a very simple budgeting app. Adding features to this will use 
implementation, doing this will allow a few developers (1-3) to implement a new feature, such as the loan tracker, this will then be prototyped by all
other developers -- to make sure the feature pertains to the goals of BetrBudget, and that it works. The advantage here is that the MVP only has a few functional 
features that we will be implementing, these being functional requirements 1, 2, and 3. Thus keeping the scope consistent and reliable, the base MVP will allow 
us to gather information via prototyping the other functional requirements as in whenever a new feature is added onto the MVP, we can test possible users 
to see if the feature is something that they would actually use. Development for the entirety of BetrBudget will require adequate implementation and protyping of
the MVP
